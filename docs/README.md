# Readme

This is a test readme file that will be rendered by [Docute](https://docute.org/) when viewed via GitHub Pages.

It is a simple way to provide documentation for the uibuilder project.

Please note that this is currently just a test. Once uibuilder v2 goes live, there will be more to see.

For now, please see additional documentation:

* In the main [README file](https://github.com/TotallyInformation/node-red-contrib-uibuilder/blob/master/README.md)
* In the [WIKI](https://github.com/TotallyInformation/node-red-contrib-uibuilder/wiki)
